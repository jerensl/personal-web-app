### Overview

Personal Web App is a web application for a portfolio website that maximizes technology such as a progressive web app to target mobile users leverage by caching so user can still get the content while there are offline.

### Goals

1. Personal Branding  
   As professionals are good to have branding because people can see what are we value and what we are doing, besides that we can get job security and exposure to our project
2. Create the best reading experience for the user  
   Most of our distractions can come from the internet, but when we don't have any connection to the internet is the best time to get focus to be productive. This is one of the main reasons this website was built using the progressive web app, leveraged by cache so we can still access content offline, another reason is in terms of size web app is smaller than the android app, because they are leverage by a browser itself as their runtime
3. Showcase personal project  
   Documentation is being a key part of a project, with great documentation, we can make another person understand what we are doing and what are trying to accomplish with greater context about the situation

### Features

-   Blog

    -   Article on the blog is a primary feature to communicate with the audience especially the developer for sharing an idea or validate my understanding of the concept I studying.
    -   Commenting on the article is one secondary feature to communicate with the audience about the content I wrote, validate understanding of the concept, and if any flaws are found they can tell me on the comment.
    -   Searching is one of the supporting features to help users to get the content they want faster.
    -   Tagging is one of supporting features for users to access content around the topic of their interest

-   Project

    -   Project Documentation is one of the primary features of getting opportunities, it will be helpful for potential coworkers, hiring managers, and recruiters about areas of my expertise and the problem I want to solve, and of course for my audience to learn about what decision I have been made.

-   Notification
    -   Notification is one of the supporting features for users to get noticed about new content on this blog, unfortunately the feature is still triggered manually and the database is ephemeral, so when a new deployment is delivered all of the users who subscribed notifications will be reset.

-   Deploy using Azure Static Web App leveraged by Github Actions for continuous deployement
-   Automate Test using Github Actions for continuous integration
-   Integrate within Notification Api Backend(Golang)
