### Overview

Personal Web App is a web application for a portfolio website that maximizes technology such as a progressive web app to target mobile users leverage by caching so user can still get the content while there are offline.

### Goals

This is one of the main reasons this website was built using the progressive web app, leveraged by cache so we can still access content offline, another reason is in terms of size web app is smaller than the android app, because they are leverage by a browser itself as their runtime
3. Showcase personal project  
   Documentation is being a key part of a project, with great documentation, we can make another person understand what we are doing and what are trying to accomplish with greater context about the situation
