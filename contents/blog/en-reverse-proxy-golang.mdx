Reverse proxy will bring anonymity to the server behind it and make the server more secure because users don't know where they will interact within, another benefit is caching and load balancing. On the other hand, golang provides an easy way to build a reverse proxy using standard library httputil.

```go showLineNumbers theme=orange
package main

func main() {
    fmt.Printf("Starting users service at port: %v", os.Getenv("PORT"))
	if err := http.ListenAndServe(":"+os.Getenv("PORT"), nil); err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
}

```
