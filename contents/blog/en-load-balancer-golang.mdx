In the past, we have learned about, how to build a reverse proxy.
Today we will learn another use case of reverse proxy which is a load balancer.
To get started i will assume you already know about docker and docker-compose

There are several types of algorithms to distribute traffic in a load balance but for simplicity,
we will implement the round-robin algorithm, which is a dumb algorithm that goes to every single node one by one.

## Store Backend

For the sake of simplicity, we will store all of the backends in a struct, which consists value of:

1. URL Host of internal backend
2. Utility function of reverse proxy in go

Both values in the Backend struct are a pointer,
so the idea to store a value as a pointer because either `Url.Parse()` or `NewSingleHostReverseProxy()`
is returned a pointer too.

```go showlinenumbers theme=orange
type Backend struct {
	URL				*url.URL
	ReverseProxy 	*httputil.ReverseProxy
}
```

After that we need another struct, to store a pool of backend and counter to count visited backend by the index of the array.

```go showlinenumbers theme=orange
type ServerPool struct {
	Backends    []*Backend
	current     uint64
}
```

To add a reverse proxy we need to make a method from a ServerPool struct,
the method needs to be a pointer so it will be a reference to the backend struct memory address,
so we can stored the data in memory.
There are 2 things we need to do before appending the server:

1. Parsing from raw string URL to a structure of URL.
2. Create a new reverse proxy using NewSingleHostReverseProxy.

Then we append the reverse proxy with an URL struct to Server Pool.

```go showlinenumbers theme=orange
func (bp *ServerPool) AddServer(host string) {
	serviceUrl, err := url.Parse(host)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	reverseProxy := httputil.NewSingleHostReverseProxy(serviceUrl)

	bp.Backends = append(bp.Backends, &Backend{
		URL: serviceUrl,
		ReverseProxy: reverseProxy,
	})
}
```

## Visited the Backend Node

At this part, we want to implement visiting a server from Server Pool. Before that,
we need to count our visiting node index, so we can track where we are at our current position.

Because under the hood HTTP request in golang is a concurrent operation,
we should use the synchronization method to increment the counter position, to avoid data race.
There are other methods that are cheap than locking for synchronization, which is an atomic operation.
So let's implement the method for increment index.

In GetNextIndex method after we add the current index position,
we use modulus so the value is not greater than the maximum total of the backend available.
Then for the current index position multiple by two is greater than a total of the backend minus one we reset it to zero.
The reason we do this way is that we want to compare it first then adding

```go showlinenumbers theme=orange
func (bp *ServerPool) GetNextIndex() int {
	if int(atomic.LoadUint64(&bp.current)) > len(bp.Backends)*2-1 {
		atomic.StoreUint64(&bp.current, 0)
	}

	return int(atomic.AddUint64(&bp.current, uint64(1)) % uint64(len(bp.Backends)))
}
```

After tracking the position of the index, now we want to return our backend based on the position we already track.

```go showlinenumbers theme=orange
func (bp *ServerPool) GetNextServer() *Backend {
	index := bp.GetNextIndex()

	return bp.Backends[index]
}
```

## Prepare a HTTP Handler

The first thing i want to do is to declare global variable from the struct then
I want to call GetNextServer() from the serverPool struct to get the server,
after that serving the server using the serve method

```go showlinenumbers theme=orange
var serverPool ServerPool
func UsersLoadBalancer(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	server := serverPool.GetNextServer()

	server.ReverseProxy.ServeHTTP(w, r)
}
```

There are possibility the server is being down, so i want to make a global variable as initial valye
to track how many servers we already visited, and if all servers are already being visited,
then we return HTTP error Service not Available.

To store the total count we visit I want to use context value, it will passed to the HTTP request,
and for each error from reverse proxy it will call the HTTP server again to serve the next server

```go showlinenumbers theme=orange
const Visit int = 1

func GetVisitingNodeFromContext(r *http.Request) int {
	if visit, ok := r.Context().Value(Visit).(int); ok {
		return visit
	}

	return 0
}

func UsersLoadBalancerErrorHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request, err error) {
	visiting := GetVisitingNodeFromContext(r)

	if visiting > len(serverPool.Backends) {
		http.Error(w, "Service not available", http.StatusServiceUnavailable)
		return
	}

	ctx := context.WithValue(r.Context(), Visit, visiting+1)
	UsersLoadBalancer(w, r.WithContext(ctx))
}
```

## Finishing the server

To wrap up, We will use strings split which takes from the environment variable and separates each host with ';',
after that, we append every single backend to the server pool.
In the end, we started our HTTP server.

```go showlinenumbers theme=orange
func main() {
	users := strings.Split(os.Getenv("USERS_SERVICE"), ";")

	for _, user := range users {
		serverPool.AddServer(user)
	}

	http.HandleFunc("/", UsersLoadBalancer)

	fmt.Printf("Starting users service at port: %v", os.Getenv("PORT"))
	if err := http.ListenAndServe(":"+os.Getenv("PORT"), nil); err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
}
```

## Run the application

So to get started, we need to clone from [this](https://github.com/jerensl/reverse-proxy-gateway) repo and cd to the repository:

```bash theme=orange
	git clone https://github.com/jerensl/reverse-proxy-gateway.git
```

After that, we need to run the reverse proxy and backend using docker-compose

```bash theme=orange
	docker-compose up
```

To test the reverse proxy we can use the curl command

```bash theme=orange
	curl -i http://localhost:5000/
```

To check docker container id we can use this command

```bash theme=orange
	docker ps
```

The last test is we can kill the server using docker command based on the server id

```bash theme=orange
	docker stop c95e20564e20
```

## Summary

Now we have already built our own load balancer, it turns out it is pretty easy to implement in golang, and the code is under 100 lines.
