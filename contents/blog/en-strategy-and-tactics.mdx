The terms “strategy” and “tactics” both originated as military terminology and are now widely used in various fields. Here’s a simple way to understand the difference:

-   **Strategy** is an action plan that outlines your long-term goals and how you plan to achieve them. It provides the big picture and sets the direction and destination of your efforts. For example, if you're goal is to be rich, its strategy would be to go to the place which have a good amount of money.
-   **Tactics**, on the other hand, are the specific actions or steps you take to achieve your strategic goals. They are much more concrete and are often oriented toward smaller steps and a shorter time frame along the way. In the same example above goals tactics could how you got a resources to go there or how your plan to get there as quickly as possible.

At their core, "strategy outlines your desired destination" while "tactics chart the course to get there." Both elements are integral to realizing ambitions and should be seen as complementary—strategy and tactics—not as opposing forces. They function in tandem, with strategy offering the grand blueprint and tactics providing the step-by-step details necessary to bring the plan to fruition.

## Core Insight

The adage "correlation does not imply causation" resonates deeply when contemplating strategy; the relationship between strategy and tactics is correlative, not causal is a fundamental concept in statistics that is crucial for strategic thinking. This principle warns us that just because two variables may move together, it does not mean that one causes the other. This understanding is especially important when considering the relationship between strategy and tactics.

Strategy refers to a high-level plan to achieve one or more goals under conditions of uncertainty, while tactics are the actual means used to gain an objective. While they are related, the connection is not necessarily one of direct cause and effect.

Consider an FPS esports team that employs a strategy to maximize kills by utilizing top-tier gear in the game. Observing a correlation between the use of this gear and increased kills might imply that the strategy is effective. However, it’s essential to recognize that correlation does not necessarily imply causation. Other factors, such as map complexity or the opposing team’s competitive advantage, could also impact kill outcomes.

Understanding the distinction between correlation and causation in the context of strategy and tactics can prevent leaders from making hasty decisions based on misleading data. It encourages a deeper analysis of the situation, considering multiple variables and potential confounding factors.

In strategic planning, it's essential to test hypotheses, collect and analyze data, and consider alternative explanations for the observed outcomes. This rigorous approach helps to ensure that strategies are effective and that the tactics employed are genuinely contributing to the desired outcomes, rather than being falsely credited due to mere correlation.

In conclusion, recognizing the correlative, not causal, relationship between strategy and tactics enables more informed decision-making and helps to build strategies that are robust, resilient, and capable of achieving their intended results.
